# Days Until We Meet
‚è∞ üíë : Simple online day countdown 

...

Made this in React (the code on `master` branch) before realizing that websites need to be hosted. The code on the `gh-pages` branch is far simpler and allows me to use GitHub to [host the website](shivankaul.com/daysuntilwemeet/). 

Two things can be modified - the target date (to countdown until) and the link to which the heart navigates. Both these things can be set (for React code on `master`) in [`app.js`](https://github.com/ShivanKaul/daysuntilwemeet/edit/master/js/app.js) and (for simple html/css/js hosted on GitHub Pages) in [index.js](https://github.com/ShivanKaul/daysuntilwemeet/blob/gh-pages/index.js).
